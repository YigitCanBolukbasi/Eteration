Eteration App
Eteration App is a web application that lists cars. You can filter the cars by brand, model, date and price, and sort them accordingly. On the right side of the application, you can view the items that you have added to your cart and remove them if you wish. The total price of the items in your cart is also displayed in the same section. To view the details of a car, simply click on its card.
